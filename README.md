# p0opy Bot

Discord bot to keep track of everyone's bowel movement.

## How it works?
- User post ðŸ’© everytime they ðŸ’©
- Bot will keep track of the occurance and keep a tally
- At the end of the month generate statistic

## Why discord?
For some people, discord is basically their second life, where they communicate with people and gather all their news from Discord.
Some people use it as a diary, to tell the world what they do today.
